# DataScience

This repository contains a data science project I completed in order to quantify user-behvavior on a technology platform.

Each file contains multiple python scripts that extract, transform, and display user-data into useful metrics. In this way, the code can function as computing tools that, at any time, can be employed to quantify user-behavior.
