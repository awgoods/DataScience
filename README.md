# DataScience

This repository contains two data science projects I completed in order to quantify user-behvavior on a technology platform.

Each file contains multiple python scripts that extract, transform, and display user-data into useful metrics. In this way, both libraries (userData and security), can function as computing tools that, at any time, can be employed to quantify user-behavior. 

Skills required to complete these projects include: APIs, Python, Statistics, and User-centric thinking.
